# Relabeling Minimal Training Subset to Flip a Prediction
Official implementation for the paper " Relabeling Minimal Training Subset to Flip a Prediction"

# Instruction
1. The Algorithm is in ```IP``` function under ```Smallest_k.py```. 
2. To run algorithms for the ```SST``` dataset, you can use the command below:
```
mkdir results
python SST.py
```
3. To run algorithms for the ```SST``` feature extracted from BERT, you can use the command:
```
python SST_bert.py
```
4. You can download other processed datasets and hyperparameter information via https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eciel/Smallest_k_experiment.
